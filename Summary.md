The Batch Payroll Application use case diagram represents how the payroll system manages employee payments and related operations. The Payroll Admin initiates the process through the Run Daily Payroll Cycle, which includes key activities such as calculating pay, deducting union dues, and generating payments and reports.

Different employee types—Hourly, Salaried, and Commission Employees—interact with the system based on their payment methods: hourly employees submit timecards, commission employees submit sales receipts, and salaried employees automatically receive their monthly salary. The system also handles union deductions, overtime, and commissions through extended use cases.

Payments are distributed through multiple channels including direct bank deposit, postal mail, or pickup from the Paymaster, ensuring all employees are paid correctly and on time. The diagram clearly shows how all actors and processes collaborate within the payroll system’s workflow.
